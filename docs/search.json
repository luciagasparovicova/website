      "contents": "\nStudy to Revise the Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen (FEEL-KJ)\nGeneral Information\nThe Fragebogen zur Erhebung der Emotionsregulation bei Kindern und Jugendlichen (FEEL-KJ)\nis a questionnaire that is utilized in school and clinical psychology to assess how children and adolescents aged 10 - 19 years regulate their anger, sadness and fear. Children and adolescents can deal with these emotions using adaptive or maladaptive strategies. Frequent use of the latter is disadvantageous for children’s and adolescents’ well-being, whereas frequent use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies is beneficial for their well-being. Therefore, applied psychologist want to improve the use of adaptive and decrease the use of maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in help-seeking children and adolescents. The FEEL-KJ is a means for applied psychologists to gain further insight into a help-seeking child’s or adolescents’ use of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies.\nThe current study’s aim, lead by Prof. Dr. Alexander Grob and managed by me, is to collect data to psychometrically examine and revise the FEEL-KJ. This will ensure that assessments resulting from the implementation of the FEEL-KJ are reliable and useful for applied psychologists helping children and adolescents, as well as researchers investigating the subject of emotion regulation in children and adolescents.\nYou can find more detailed information on the official FEEL-KJ study website .\nUpdates on the FEEL-KJ Study\nWe have completed data collection and are completing administrative and archival tasks for\nstudy termination. Moreover, the study data is currently being analysed.\n\n\n\n",
